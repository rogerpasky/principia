        Principia is a JavaScript library who offers virtual experiments to test and learn the laws
        of physics. This is not a perfect simulator, but it's good enough to have fun and enjoy the
        science for a while playing with the Universe in <strong>God mode</strong>.

      <h2>Newton's Laws</h2>
      Newton Laws are as beauty as powerful in their simplicity.
      <div class="indent lateral">
        <h3>Newton's 1st law (Law of Inertia)</h3>
        <p>
          Newton was clever enought to understand the true nature of movement is to keep on moving
          forever unless something stops it. This is called <strong>Uniform Motion</strong> and it was 
          a counter-intuitive proposal (even nowadays for a lot of people) because everything we start 
          moving in planet Earth surface ends up stopping due to external forces like friction with 
          floor or air.
        </p>

          <h4>Let's throw a star with a initial velocity and see what happens</h4>
          <p>
            In this experiment there are no surrounding elements who can influence the movement of such a 
            <strong>lonely star</strong>, so it should go on forever with the initial velocity. This velocity has been 
            stated as "advance a distance equal to <strong>one diameter of the star</strong> in the path 
            of <strong>X axis</strong> per <strong>second</strong>". There will be created new axes every 
            second wherever the center of the star is, and because of Newton's first law they should appear
            separated by one star diameter each other.

        <h3>Newton's 2nd law (Force generates acceleration)</h3>
        <p>
          When a force is applied to a body, it will gain velocity gradually (this is called <strong>
          Accelerated Motion</strong>). But it doesn't applies the same way to all bodies, because the 
          more mass it has, the less acceleration it will get (its velocity will increase in a slower 
          manner), just like pushing with the same force a skateboard or a car.
        </p>

          <h4>Let's drop a small version of planet Mercury to the Sun</h4>
          <p>
            Physical objects (the ones who has mass) generate a force among them called "gravity" (more 
            about this later). This force makes things fall towards the cented of the Earth or, in this 
            case, the Sun. We can drop a stone, an apple or, in this case, a full planet like Mercury.
            Acceleration means <strong>velocity</strong> will <strong>grow</strong> gradually every second, 
            so the <strong>distance</strong> the body advances will <strong>"double" grow </strong> every 
            second (according to the square of the elapsed seconds). There will appear axes every ten
            seconds in the center of Mercury as it is falling, and you will realize the distance among
            axes gets bigger and biger through time (one diameter, two, tree...).
            <a href="newtonlaw2.html"><span class="key"> Go to experiment </span></a>
          </p>
          <p>
            Note some <strong>extra details</strong>: Mercury has been reduced (just as "tiny" as one and 
            a half mount Everest) to make its diameter fit in this experiment, placing it in that precise 
            starting point and pushing it with a precise initial velocity so it can advance in the required 
            steps. Detailed calculations are shown in source code. Another interesting detail is gravity 
            force is not constant, because it varies with the distance to the center of the Sun in this 
            case, so the closer it gets the stronger is the force. If you look closely tho the last axes 
            you will notice they are getting closer to the Sun than it was supposed to be.
          </p>

      <div class="indent lateral">
        <h3>Newton's 3rd law (Action-Reaction Law)</h3>
        <p>
          All forces between objects exist in equal magnitude and opposite direction. If one object pushes 
          a force on a second object, the second one pushes the same force on the first one, but oppsite, 
          just like pushing someone over ice, he will move forward, but you'll move backwards. Same applies 
          to pulling. The net sum of all the interaction forces of all objets will add up to zero.
        </p>
        <div class="indent transparent">
          <h4>Let's drop two identical Suns, one towards each other</h4>
          <p>
            Two identical objects will get attracted with same force intensity each one, so they will meet 
            at the midpoint. Because stars are so huge and distnces are really, really big, they are going 
            to spend more than eight hours to start touching at the end of the fall, we have <strong>
            accelerated time</strong> to make it one thousand faster (1 life second = 1000 simulated seconds) 
            so you do not get bored. One new axes set will be drom every hour at the center of each star.
            <a href="newtonlaw3.html"><span class="key"> Go to experiment </span></a>
          </p>
          <p>
            Please notice the centers of both objects was separated 3 million Kilometers each to the coordinates
            origin (marked at the center of the big axes) so, being both affected by two equal opposite 
            forces, they <strong>end up at very center</strong>, as it should be. The distances they are marking 
            every hour are increasing in a similar accelerating pattern as the one we saw in the second law example.

      <h2>Orbital Movement</h2>
      When Uniform Motion and Accelerated Motion (derived from gravity forces) are combined, some magic happens. If the 
      resulting movement is a periodical loop, it is called <srtong>Orbital Motion</srtong>. All those beautiful 
      movements have been generated with the solely equations of the three Newton Laws.

        <h3>Solar Systems</h3>
        <p>
          We have an excellent example in the neiborghood. We call it Solar System, and it is well known with known masses
          and velocities, but we can imagine other solar systems...
        </p>
        <div class="indent transparent">
          <h4>Inner Solar System</h4>
          <p>
            let's watch a subset of our Solar System, made up of the rocky planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth and its Moon and 
            Mars). Initial distances to Sun and velocities are the <strong>average</strong> ones that appears in Wikipedia, 
            but they are not precisely placed at the actual locations in a determined date (they are all aligned in the X 
            axis).
