      <h1>Principia</h1>
      <p><strong>Using three.js 3D library to teach physics, programming and encourage young nerds.</strong></p><br>
      <p>
        Principia is a JavaScript library who offers virtual experiments to test and learn the laws
        of physics. This is not a perfect simulator, but it's good enough to have fun and enjoy the
        science for a while.

      <h2>Newton's Laws</h2>
      Newton Laws are as beauty as powerful in their simplicity.

        <h3>Newton's 1st law (Law of Inertia)</h3>
        <p>
          Newton was clever enought to understand the true nature of movement is to keep on moving
          forever unless something stops it. This was a counter-intuitive proposal (even nowadays for
          a lot of people) because everything we start moving in planet Earth surface ends up stopping
          due to external forces like friction with floor or air.

          <h4>Let's throw a star with a initial velocity and see what happens</h4>
          <p>
            In this experiment there are no surrounding elements who can influence the movement of such a 
            <strong>lonely star</strong>, so it should go on forever with the initial velocity. This velocity has been 
            stated as "advance a distance equal to <strong>one diameter of the star</strong> in the path 
            of <strong>x axis</strong> per <strong>second</strong>". There will be created new axes every 
            second wherever the center of the star is, and because of Newton's first law they should appear
            separated by one star diameter each other.

        <h3>Newton's 2nd law (Force generates acceleration)</h3>
        <p>
          When a force is applied to a body, it will gain velocity gradually (this is called "acceleration").
          But it doesn't applies the same way to all bodies, because the more mass it has, the less 
          acceleration it will get (its velocity will increase in a slower manner), just like pushing with 
          the same force a skateboard or a car.

          <h4>Let's drop a small version of planet Mercury to the Sun</h4>
          <p>
            Physical objects (the ones who has mass) generate a force among them called "gravity" (more 
            about this later). This force makes things fall towards the cented of the Earth or, in this 
            case, the Sun. We can drop a stone, an apple or, in this case, a full planet like Mercury.
            Acceleration means <strong>velocity</strong> will <strong>grow</strong> gradually every second, 
            so the <strong>distance</strong> the body will advance will <strong>"double" grow </strong> 
            every second (according to the square of the elapsed seconds). There will appear axes every 
            ten seconds in the center of Mercury as it is falling, and you will realize the distance among
            axes gets bigger and biger through time (one diameter, two, tree...).
            <a href="newtonlaw2.html"><span class="key"> Go to experiment </span></a>
          </p>
          <p>
            Note some <strong>extra details</strong>: Mercury has been reduced (just as "tiny" as one and 
            a half mount Everest) to make its diameter fit in this experiment, placing it in that precise 
            starting point and pushing it with a precise initial velocity so it can advance in the required 
            steps. Detailed calculations are in source code. Another interesting detail is gravity force 
            is not constant, because it varies with the distance to the center of the Sun in this case, so 
            the closer it gets the stronger is the force. If you look closely tho the last axes you will 
            notice they are getting closer to the Sun than it was supposed to be.
